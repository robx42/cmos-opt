		FREEWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT, VERSION 2008, 2015		
	for Analog CMOS Design, Tradeoffs and Optimization design spreadsheets			
			Copyright © 2000-2008 David M. Binkley	
				
ATTENTION. READ CAREFULLY:				
				
By downloading, copying, or using the Analog CMOS Design, Tradeoffs and Optimization design				
spreadsheets or downloading, copying, using, or distributing their derivatives (pursuant to Section				
2.2, you may only distribute derivatives), you agree to the following FREEWARE LICENSE				
AGREEMENT (“Agreement”).				
			 	
1. LICENSE. David M. Binkley (“author”) hereby grants licensee (“you”) a non-exclusive license to				
use the Analog CMOS Design, Tradeoffs and Optimization design spreadsheets (“the				
spreadsheets”), copyrighted by the author, and their derivatives. “Derivatives” collectively refer to				
changes to the operation of the MOSFETs, Circuit Analysis (where present), Process, or				
License, Notes sheets in the spreadsheets, excluding changes in user inputs or the addition or				
deletion of spreadsheet columns for different MOSFETs or MOSFET models. “Derivatives” also				
collectively refer to changes to the spreadsheet software code (“software code”) or the addition of				
different sheets to the spreadsheets. Under the terms of this license, you may:				
				
1.1. Use the spreadsheets or derivatives on any computer in your possession.				
				
1.2. Make copies of the spreadsheets or derivatives for your own use.				
				
2. LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE. The license granted in Section 1 is subject to the following				
restrictions:				
				
2.1. The spreadsheets or derivatives may not be offered for sale or embedded within a product				
offered for sale.				
				
2.2. The spreadsheets may not be distributed to others, but can be separately downloaded by				
others from the author (the intention here is to track the use of the spreadsheets). Derivatives				
may be distributed to others, although the author encourages spreadsheet downloads from the				
author as a way to track the use of the spreadsheets and derivatives.				
				
2.3. The copyright notices located at the top of MOSFETs, Circuit Analysis (where present),				
Process, and License, Notes sheets and at the top of the software code must be preserved in				
the spreadsheets. For spreadsheet derivatives, a prominent notice, “Derived from the Analog				
CMOS Design, Tradeoffs and Optimization design spreadsheet, Copyright © 2000-2008 David M.				
Binkley”, must appear at the top of all derivative sheets and at the top of derivative software code.				
				
2.4. The FREEWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT located on the License, Notes sheet must be				
preserved in the spreadsheets and derivatives.				
				
2.5. When the spreadsheets are included in publications or presentations, credit should be given				
to the author. When derivatives are included in publications or presentations, credit should be				
given to the author for the original spreadsheets used for the derivatives.				
				
3. NOT FOR ACTUAL DESIGN, NO WARRANTY, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND				
INDEMNIFICATION.				
				
3.1. The spreadsheets and derivatives are intended for design guidance only, not for actual				
design, and do not correspond to any particular CMOS fabrication process. You must				
independently validate designs using MOS models and parameters appropriate for the actual				
fabrication process used.				
				
3.2. Use of the spreadsheets or derivatives expressly indicates the assumption of risk that these				
should only be used for design guidance and should not be used for actual design or the				
validation of actual design. Additionally, use of the spreadsheets or derivatives expressly				
indicates acknowledgement of responsibility for independently validating designs using MOS				
models and parameters appropriate for the actual fabrication process used.				
				
3.3. The spreadsheets and derivatives are provided without express or implied warranties that the				
information is accurate or reliable, and there are no warranties as to fitness for any particular				
purpose. The author accepts no responsibility or liability for loss or damage occasioned to any				
person or property through using the spreadsheets or derivatives, or acting or refraining from				
acting as a result of such use. The author expressly disclaims all implied warranties, including				
merchantability of fitness for any particular purpose. There will be no duty on the author to correct				
any errors or defects in the spreadsheets or derivatives.				
				
3.4. You and those you distribute derivatives to (pursuant to Section 2.2, you may only distribute				
derivatives) shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the author from any claim, demand,				
liability, damage award, suit, judgment, or other legal action arising out of your use, distribution,				
modification, or duplication of the spreadsheets or derivatives.				
				
4. TERMINATION. The license granted hereunder is effective until terminated by the author. You				
may terminate this license at any time by destroying all copies of the spreadsheets and				
derivatives. This license will terminate automatically if you do not comply with the limitations				
described above. On termination of the license, you must destroy all copies of the spreadsheets				
and derivatives.				
				
5. EXPORT CONTROLS. None of the spreadsheets or derivatives may be downloaded or				
otherwise exported or re-exported into, or to a national or resident of, any country in violation of				
the laws and administrative regulations of the United States relating to the control of exports of				
commodities and technical data. By downloading or using the spreadsheets or derivatives, you				
are agreeing to the foregoing, and you are representing and warranting that you are not located				
in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country.				
				
6. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and representations				
between you and the author. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted pursuant to the				
laws of the United States and the State of Tennessee. Any legal action, suit, or proceeding				
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof shall be instituted in a state court				
of competent jurisdiction in the State of Tennessee or in a federal court of competent				
jurisdiction in the State of Tennessee and each party hereby consents and submits to the				
personal jurisdiction of such court, waiving any objection to venue in such court.				
				
				
				NOTES:
				
Design spreadsheets are compatible with Microsoft Excel 2003 and later versions.				
				
IF SPREADSHEET CELLS DO NOT DISPLAY RESULTS CORRECTLY, EXCEL MACROS MUST				
BE ENABLED. THIS IS DONE BY ENABLING MACROS THROUGH THE EXCEL OPTIONS.				
				
CHANGES TO MODEL PARAMETERS ON THE PROCESS SHEET REQUIRE RECALCULATION,				
WHICH CAN BE DONE BY "CLICKING" ON MOS DESIGN INPUTS ON THE MOSFETS SHEET.				
				
Design spreadsheets are illustrated in David M. Binkley, Tradeoffs and Optimization in Analog CMOS Design,				
John Wiley and Sons, Ltd, 2008, ISBN: 978-0-470-03136-0, www.wiley.com/go/binkley_tradeoffs.				
User inputs and performance calculations for the spreadsheets are described in detail in the book Appendix.
