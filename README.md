# CMOS Optimization Library

## Description
This code is intended for intial design for analog CMOS circuits.  It uses parameters common from SPICE definition files to provide simplified circuit approximations so that less iteration is required after initial design.

## How to use
Intended to be used with an accompanying Jupyter notebook, or a python-macro enabled spreadsheet.  See example design notebooks.
